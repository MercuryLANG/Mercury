# Mercury
A python programming language i made for some reason.


# Syntax
Check https://mercurylang.github.io for the docs.
Also I am working on a VS code extension for Mercury intellisense and etc.

# Comments
++ is a single line comment
+- is a multi line comment start
+* is a multi line comment
-+ is a multi line comment end

# Modules
Similar to python, but with "use" instead of "import".

Example:
If i have a function "helloworld();" that runs "write("Hello World!");" in a file named "mod.merc", i would type "use mod".
You should use Python files/pip dependancies for this, as Mercury is built in Python and is really early in development.
